    <p>They have released four studio albums: Caress Your Soul (2013), Land of Pleasure (2014), Westway (The Glitter & The Slums) (2016), and Yours to Keep (2019) as well as three EP's: Helping Hand (2009), Extended Play (2010), and Happy Endings (2011). Their third album was the first album to debut and appear at number 1 on the Australian Albums Chart.</p>
        
    </p>The band was formed after Cornwall and Best saw Frost busking outside of the Coopers Hotel in Newtown.
        In 2009, Sticky Fingers played their first live show and released their debut EP titled Helping Hand. The EP showcases the early sound of Sticky Fingers which is mainly reggae driven, and includes the songs "Inspirational" and "Juicy Ones" which were later re-recorded for their Extended Play EP. The EP credits Taras Hrubyj-Piper for guitar and keyboard work, as well as Caroline De Dear and rapper Mute Mc for vocal work on the song "Lyrical Stoka".
        Sticky Fingers released the Extended Play EP in October 2010 (through sureshaker), and the acoustic EP Happy Endings in October 2011. </p>

       <p> After having their applications to play the Newtown Festival rejected on two consecutive occasions, in 2010, Sticky Fingers set up their own DIY stage in a friend's backyard nearby on the day of the festival. The renegade performance caught the attention of promoters, and notably, producer Dan Hume, who would go on to produce their next 3 records. Sticky Fingers also went on to headline Newtown Festival the next year.
        On 5 December 2016 the band announced they would be going on an indefinite hiatus in February, due to several internal issues. On 26 March 2018, the band announced their return via their instagram account.
        The members of the band are: Dylan Frost, Paddy Cornwal, Eric da Silva Gruener, Seamus Coyle and Daniel Neurath. </p>
